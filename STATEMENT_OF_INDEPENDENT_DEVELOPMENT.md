# 📄 Statement of Independent Development

I, **Dylan Dettloff**, developed this software tool (“LCA Bot”) independently.

## ✅ Ownership and Scope

This tool was created entirely:
- On my **personal time**
- Using **personal equipment and resources**
- Without the use of **company data**, **internal documents**, or **confidential information**
- Outside the scope of my internship at **Boundless Impact Research & Analytics**

## 🛠️ Description

The LCA Bot generates ISO-compliant Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) reports using AI-generated narrative, structured templates, and automated data visualizations. It accepts both manually entered product names and user-uploaded inventory data (e.g., CSV or OpenLCA JSON).

## 🔐 Boundaries

- This tool does **not reuse** or incorporate proprietary systems, client lists, tools, datasets, or IP owned by Boundless.
- The functionality and structure are entirely original and based on publicly available methods and standards (e.g., ISO 14040/44).
- This bot was **not developed as part of my internship job description**.

## 📅 Date of Development

Development began in **April 2025** and continued independently alongside my academic work.
